# Zapp

An experimental project to create a simple effect when the mouse clicked on to screen. This project is highly inspired by [this](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1984456). I tried to create the same effect without using p5.js library. Checkout the demo at [here](https://erik3010.github.io/zapp/).
