This is my fun experimental project. Try to click on the screen and see some cool effects appearing. This project is highly inspired by [this](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1984456). I tried to create the same effect but without using p5.js library. Check out the demo [here](https://erik3010.github.io/zapp/).
